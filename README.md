# CFM_Challenge_2019

For the course "L'apprentissage par reseaux de neurones profonds", I chose to work on the challenge proposed by CFM: Prediction of daily
stock movements on the US market. More concretely, we have the returns between 9h30 and 15h20 over 5 minute windows and we need to predict the sign of the return from 15h20 to 16h. A major issue in handling this challenge is the fact that stock movements are practically random. In this report we present our approach to get to the 19th place over 45 in the public leaderboard (52.42% accuracy).
